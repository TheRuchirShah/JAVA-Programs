#  The Complete JAVA

Hi! My name is Ruchir.

  

This is a complete introduction to JAVA programming language from Beginner to Advance level.

##  What is Java

  

Java is a **programming language** and a **platform**. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

  

Java was developed by _Sun Microsystems_ (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. _James Gosling_ is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was _Oak_. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java.

  

Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as *Windows*, *Mac OS*, and the various versions of *UNIX*.

  

Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

  
  
  
  

##  Java Example

  

Let's have a quick look at Java programming example. It is a program to display "*Hello, World!*" in JAVA programming language.

  

class example

{

public static void main(String args[])

{

System.out.println("Hello, World!");

}

}

  
  
  

##  Application

  

According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:

  

1. Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.

2. Web Applications such as [Indian Rayways](https://www.irctc.co.in/) (website), etc.

3. Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.

4. Mobile

5. Embedded System

6. Smart Card

7. Robotics

8. Games, etc.

  
  
  

##  Features of Java

  

-  **Object Oriented** − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

-  **Platform Independent** − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

-  **Simple** − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.

-  **Secure** − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

-  **Architecture-neutral** − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.

-  **Portable** − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

-  **Robust** − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.

-  **Multithreaded** − With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.

-  **Interpreted** − Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.

-  **High Performance** − With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.

-  **Distributed** − Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.

-  **Dynamic** − Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.

  
  
  

##  Types of Java Applications

  

There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:

  

####  1) Standalone Application

  

Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

  

####  2) Web Application

  

An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, [Servlet](https://www.javatpoint.com/servlet-tutorial), [JSP](https://www.javatpoint.com/jsp-tutorial), [Struts](https://www.javatpoint.com/struts-2-tutorial), [Spring](https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-tutorial), [Hibernate](https://www.javatpoint.com/hibernate-tutorial), [JSF](https://www.javatpoint.com/jsf-tutorial), etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.

  

####  3) Enterprise Application

  

An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, [EJB](https://www.javatpoint.com/ejb-tutorial) is used for creating enterprise applications.

  

####  4) Mobile Application

  

An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

  
  
  

##  Java Platforms / Editions

  

There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:

  

####  1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)

  

It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, [String](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string), Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.

  

####  2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)

  

It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on the top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, [JPA](https://www.javatpoint.com/jpa-tutorial), etc.

  

####  3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)

  

It is a micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile applications.

  

####  4) JavaFX

  

It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a light-weight user interface API.
