# Pattern in JAVA

**Java pattern program**  enhances the coding skill, logic, and looping concepts. It is mostly asked in  **Java interview**  to check the logic and thinking of the programmer. We can print a  **Java pattern program**  in different designs. To learn the pattern program, we must have a deep knowledge of the Java loop, such as  **for**  loop  **do-while**  loop. 

We have classified the  **Java** patterns  into three main categories:

 1.  **Start Pattern**
 2.  **Number Pattern**
 3.  **Character Pattern**

### Pattern Example :-

| * |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| * | * |   |   |   |
| * | * | * |   |   |
| * | * | * | * |   |
| * | * | * | * | * |

- From top-to-bottom we take it as Columns.
- From left-to-right we take it as Rows
